# action-issue-form-test

Test to create a repository based on an issue form data request.

## Prerequisites

Install a GitHub APP with the following permissions:

* Repository permissions
  * Administration: read & write
  * Contents: read only
  * Issues: read & write
  * Metadadta: read only
* Organization permissions
  * Members: read only

Once installed in the organization, restricr repository access to the
repositories you want to use with the app. In our case, we restrict
access to the `action-issue-form-test` repository.
